/* Note :
 * Primitive data types and Non-Primitive data types:
 * Primitive data types are predefined in Java, whereas non-primitive data types are not defined by Java but created by the programmer.
 * The non -primitive data types in java begin with an uppercase letter whereas primitive data type in Java begins with a lowercase letter.
 * The primitive data typeâ€™s size depends on the data type whereas all non-primitive data types have the same size.
 * Non-Primitive data types in java are also called reference types because they refer to objects.
 * Example of Non-Primitive data types or reference types : String, Employee,Student ,Person etc. -----in java begin with an uppercase letter---are not predefined by Java
 * The String data type is a non-primitive data type ,but it is predefined in java
 * Example of The primitive data types : int,char ,boolean ,float,long ,short ----in Java begins with a lowercase letter----are predefined in java
